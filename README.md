# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Getting Started
To play the Tic Tac Toe game on your local machine, follow these instructions:

  1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
  2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.
## How to play
  1. Run the executable game.cpp file of your system
  2. The game will display a 3x3 grid with numbers 1 to 9 representing each cell. To make a move, enter the number corresponding to the cell where you want to place your mark (X or O).
  3. Players take turns to enter their moves until the game ends.
  4. The game ends when one player wins by forming a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of their marks or when the game board is full and there's no winner (a draw).
